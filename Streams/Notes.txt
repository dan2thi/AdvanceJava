1) Introduced in Java 8.

2) There are two types of stream operations, intermediate(eg: map(), filter(), sorted) and terminal(eg: forEach(), collect()).

3) Intermediate operations return another stream, hence they can be chained.

4) Terminal operations should come as the last operation.

5) Stream operations do not change/mutate the original list.
